        <p>Dear Varvara,</p>

        <p>If there's one thing I can promise you it's that it's going to get worse before it gets better, you wonder why so many people walk around with unhealed trauma it's because healing is actually really really ugly and you're going to have to feel so many other emotions before you feel good and happy, you're going to have to cry and remember and feel it all again but one day you're going to wake up and feel so proud of the person that you've become and it is all going to be worth it. I know things were not good for you in the last year but believe me, everything will be alright soon. Look at you and what you have become and what you achieved so far. I have never seen such a strong woman like you who was here and faced a war situation at home and giving exam the next day. I could have never done that. I respect you for that, you are simply amazing!!</p>

        <p>You are the 2nd person whom I talked to in Germany and that’s what makes it more special. I am so so glad to meet such an amazing soul like you. I don’t know may be all your friends might also say you the same regarding the positivity you spread around when you are there but for me I never felt such an amazing connection in my life of 25 years that I felt with you. I don’t know what I can give you or gift you for your birthday, but I can promise you to be with you in your darkest times of life, and so we would overcome that together.</p>

        <p>I wish you from all my heart a very Happy Birthday Varvara!! May this year bring all the joy which you deserve, and you also have a healthy life with no grief or pain. Enjoy your day to the fullest with your loved ones. Just do remember I am always there for you.</p>

        <p>Best regards,<br>Indra</p>
